  Known Limitations:
    - N/A

  Extra Features:

  Extra Features:
    - Test scripts in test-t-1c-ok.sh and test-t-1c-bad.sh
    
  Spec Interpretations:
    - Included parsing time in the top level shell profile entry.
      This is useful because it gives you extra information about
      the syntax parsing. This will help you compensate for parsing
      time in the final evaluation of the runtime of the script.
      Also, if the syntax parsing is buggy, this will show up in the
      profiling of the shell.

  Choice of clock:
   - For logging realtime, I chose to use the MONOTONIC_CLOCK. This is
     because the MONOTONIC_CLOCK cannot be set, so it can be used as
     a reliable timer.

  Questions:
  1. No. For example, if the REALTIME_CLOCK is changed during execution
     then the first column will not necessarily be in nondecrasing order.
  2. Yes. If you have multiple threads, then the sum of the user and
     system times may be less than the real time. For example, if there
     were four threads running for one second, then the real time would be
     one second, but the sum of the user and system time would be four
     seconds.
  3. Yes. If the runtime is long enough that it causes the signed value to
     overflow, then it can be negative.
  4. We tested it with our scripts test-t-1c-ok.sh and test-t-1c-bad.sh.
     test-t-1c-ok.sh checks for interleaving. test-t-1c-bad.sh checks that
     the profile times printed are within an expected range.
