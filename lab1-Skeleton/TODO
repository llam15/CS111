Things to do:

1. Fix tokenizer for commands. Current output:

if cat 
<
 /etc/passwd 
|
 tr a-z A-Z 
|
 sort -u
;
 then :
;
 else echo sort failed!
;
 fi
;

2. Read through resulting list of tokens and create commands. Put into command_stream
2a. Check syntax. (i.e. all if has fi, all while has done, no unmatched parens etc)
2b. If syntax error, return line number
