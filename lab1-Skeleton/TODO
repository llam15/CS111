Things to do:

1a. Fix tokenizer for commands. Current output:

if cat 
<
 /etc/passwd 
|
 tr a-z A-Z 
|
 sort -u
;
 then :
;
 else echo sort failed!
;
 fi
;

1b. Tokenize comments. read up to but does not consume newline

2. Read through resulting list of tokens and create commands. Put into
command_stream 

2a. Check syntax. (i.e. all if has fi, all while has done, no
unmatched parens etc) 

2aa. Newline syntax: Check token after newline 2b. If
syntax error, return line number

3. read_command_stream: return next command in array
