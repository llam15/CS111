In the test script given, tests 16 and 17 are CPU utilization dependent. The test scripts
kill the second process too quickly if the CPU usage is high. If the CPU is too slow in 
reading, then the script will kill the process before it has finished reading, and it will 
output nothing. As a result, tests 16 and 17 will fail on slower machines, while they will 
pass on quicker machines. We determined that this was the problem rather than our code by 
lengthening the sleep time before it kills the last process, giving the CPU enough time 
to read and output the correct output before the process was killed. With the lengthened 
sleep time, the test cases passed 100% of the time. The modified test cases are as shown:

   # 16
    [ # Run in a separate subshell with job control enabled.
      '(set -m; ' .
      # (1) At 0s, grab write lock; after 0.5s, write 'aaa' and exit
      '(echo aaa | ./osprdaccess -w 3 -l -d 0.5) & ' .
      # (2) At 0.1s, wait for read lock; print first character then X
      '(sleep 0.1 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/X/ && sleep 1) & ' .
      'bgshell1=$! ; ' .
      # (3) At 0.2s, wait for read lock; print first character then Y
      '(sleep 0.2 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/Y/ && sleep 1) & ' .
      'bgshell2=$! ; ' .
      # (4) At 0.3s, kill processes in (2); this may introduce a "bubble"
      #     in the wait queue that would prevent (3) from running
      'sleep 0.3 ; kill -9 -$bgshell1 ; ' .
      # (5) At 1.3s, kill processes in (3)
      'sleep 1 ; kill -9 -$bgshell2 ' .
      # Clean up separate shell.
      ') 2>/dev/null',
      "aY"
    ],

    # 17
    [ # Run in a separate subshell with job control enabled.
      '(set -m; ' .
      # (1) At 0s, grab write lock; after 0.5s, write 'aaa' and exit
      '(echo aaa | ./osprdaccess -w 3 -l -d 0.5) & ' .
      # (2) At 0.1s, wait for read lock; print first character then X
      '(sleep 0.1 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/X/ && sleep 1) & ' .
      'bgshell1=$! ; ' .
      # (3) At 0.2s, wait for read lock; print first character then Y
      '(sleep 0.2 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/Y/ && sleep 1) & ' .
      'bgshell2=$! ; ' .
      # (4) At 0.3s, kill processes in (3); this may introduce a "bubble"
      #     in the wait queue that would prevent (2) from running
      'sleep 0.3 ; kill -9 -$bgshell2 ; ' .

      'sleep 1 ; kill -9 -$bgshell1 ' .

Using debug messages, we determined that our code services tickets in correct order, 100%
of the time. However, the console output is not necessarily in order. For example, we wrote 
our own test case similar to that of tests 16 and 17 in the given test script, but 
with five readers, rather than 2 readers. Two out of five of these readers would then be 
killed, and the output should simply be the remaining 3 processes in order. However, the output 
suffers from race conditions that do not seem to stem from our code. Sometimes the test case 
would succeed, other times it prints out of order (e.g. aUaYaW).

We suspect that the race condition is a result of the process releasing its spin lock after 
the osprd_ioctl call returns, but before calling transfer, allowing the scheduler to interrupt 
and place another process's transfer operation before that of the current process. This would 
produce out of order output regardless of the order in which tickets are processed.

The perl script is as shown below:

    # 18
    [ # Run in a separate subshell with job control enabled.
      '(set -m; ' .
      # (1) At 0s, grab write lock; after 0.5s, write 'aaa' and exit
      '(echo aaa | ./osprdaccess -w 3 -l -d 0.5) & ' .
      # (2) At 0.1s, wait for read lock; print first character then X
      '(sleep 0.1 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/X/ && sleep 2) & ' .
      'bgshell1=$! ; ' .
      # (3) At 0.2s, wait for read lock; print first character then Y
      '(sleep 0.2 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/Y/ && sleep 2) & ' .
      'bgshell2=$! ; ' .
      # (4) At 0.2s, wait for read lock; print first character then Z
      '(sleep 0.3 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/Z/ && sleep 2) & ' .
      'bgshell3=$! ; ' .
      # (5) At 0.2s, wait for read lock; print first character then W
      '(sleep 0.4 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/W/ && sleep 2) & ' .
      'bgshell4=$! ; ' .
      # (6) At 0.2s, wait for read lock; print first character then U
      '(sleep 0.5 && ./osprdaccess -r 1 -l | sed s/$/U/ && sleep 2) & ' .
      'bgshell5=$! ; ' .

      # (7) At 0.4s, kill processes in (4); this may introduce a "bubble"
      #     in the wait queue that would prevent (2-4) from running
      'sleep 0.4 ; kill -9 -$bgshell3 -$bgshell1 ; ' .
      # (8) At 0.4s, kill processes in (2); this is the second "bubble"
      'sleep 0.4 ; kill -9 -$bgshell1  ' .
      # Clean up separate shell.
